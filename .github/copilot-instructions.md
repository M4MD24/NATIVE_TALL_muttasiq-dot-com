# Copilot Repository Instructions

This is an open-source repository.

When reviewing pull requests or generating summaries:
- Always write summaries suitable for a CHANGELOG so other contributors can paste them directly into release notes.
- Focus on what changed and why it matters rather than grinding through implementation details.
- Use clear, user-facing language and avoid internal variable names or file paths unless the reviewer genuinely needs them.
- Keep summaries concise, factual, and present tense; do not speculate about intent or future work.
- After the opening sentence, follow with grouped bullet points whenever multiple highlights exist so readers can scan the key changes quickly.
- Prefer the following changelog categories when appropriate: Features, Fixes, Performance, Documentation, Refactors, Maintenance.
- When a change is small, keep the summary short and focused on the end-user impact.
